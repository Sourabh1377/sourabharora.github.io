<h2>Relax Anytime with Savasana</h2>
<p>Prepare yourself for savasana. Lie down on your yoga mat with your
arms at your side with palms up. Close your eyes and breathe slowly but
deeply. Sink into the mat and let your worries slip away. When you are
ready, roll on your side and use your arms to push yourself to a sitting
position with crossed legs. Place your hands in a prayer position.
Be grateful for all that you have in life. Namaste.
